My shitcode for enormous amount of my music. That promgram will by reading tags with taglib library rewrite files names in common style. 
Duplicate files will be marked with bad extension, like mp3_copy, so it will be noticible. And special versions, like live and so on, will be marked as well.
Also It has fitcha. If you want to "unroll" folder contented files, just put 'u' and write path to that folder!
